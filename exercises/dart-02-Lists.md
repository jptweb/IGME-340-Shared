# Dart ICE 2 - Lists

In Dartpad, create a __New Pad__ and replace everything in the editor with the following code:

### dart_lists.dart
```dart
void main() {
    
}
```

## Perform the following tasks: ##

1. Create a new `fixed size` array called `myList1` with five 0's inside, hint, use `var` for the data type. Then change item 2 to `1`, and print it.

1. Create a loosely typed `growable` list called `myList2`. Add one of every data type into the list (String, number, double, boolean), and print it.

1. Insert `IGME` into myList2 in the second array position, and print it.

1. Create a new list called `myList3` that contains `['item1', 'item2', 'item3']`, then add it all into myList2 and print it.

1. Create a new list called `myList4` that contains `[123.4, 'item 6', false]` and insert it into the very beginning of myList2 and print it.

1. Create a new `growable String` array called `myList5`, and add a few items to it and print it.

1. Remove the `3rd` item from `myList5`, and print the result.

1. Remove the `last` item from `myList5`, and print the result.

1. Remove items `2 to 5` in `myList2`, and print the result.

Save the resulting file as `dart_ice_02.dart`for submission.
